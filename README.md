# Away-From-Home-App
During the peak of the Covid pandemic and the stay at home order, it became useful to know how long a person was away from their home. A parent may desire to know how long their child stayed with their friends or how many hours were spent at the workplace. Knowing how long one was away from home could also help with time management and organizing one's day in a more structured fashion. To this end, I devised an app to automatically track how long someone was away from their house.
## Installation: 
The app is not published on the Apple App store, but the source code is given in this repository. 
## Details:
This app first spends 24 hours tracking the user's location. It determines the home based on the location someone stayed from the hours of 9 pm to 6 am. From there, it records anytime that the user has travelled away from their home and notify the user.

When the user opens the app, they will be presented with a screen that shows

1) whether the app is authorized to track your location

2) the home of the user

3) the current location of the user

4) whether the user is at home or not

5) the closest middle school to the home

6) the closet high school to the home

7) options to reset the home of the user and to refresh the location of the user
