# Away-From-Home-App
During the peak of the Covid pandemic and the stay at home order, it became useful to know how long a person was away from their home. A parent may desire to know how long their child stayed with their friends or how many hours were spent at the workplace. Knowing how long one was away from home could also help with time management and organizing one's day in a more structured fashion. To this end, I devised an app to automatically track how long someone was away from their house.
## Installation: 
The app is not published on the Apple App store, but the source code is given in this repository. 
## Details:
This app first spends 24 hours tracking the user's location. It determines the home based on the location someone stayed from the hours of 9 pm to 6 am. From there, it records anytime that the user has travelled away from their home and notify the user. 


## Acknowledgements:
I would like to personally thank Mr. Hong Hsu for his guidance and support through this process.
